# WeatherApp
A simple application that makes use of your web browser's geolocation API to determine your weather. Your location is then used in a call to the OpenWeather API to return weather data in JSON. A basic summary of the current weather and icons for the general weather conditions in the extended forecast are displayed to the user.
